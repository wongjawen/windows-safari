# Disclaimer
This is my first post in github.. ^.^

I made this because I adore the UI/UX of Safari in MacOS and due to lack of extension I moved to Firefox, and made this theme to satisfy my needs, shortly I'm not made this alone, thanks to https://github.com/AdamXweb/WhiteSurFirefoxThemeMacOS

If this is your first time customizing your Firefox through userChrome.css you should read ![userchrome.org](https://www.userchrome.org/)

with this script any improvement or suggestion are welcome

# First-Release

Tested and created in Windows 11, Firefox version 104.0.2, freshly coded with few tweaks from ![AdamXweb](https://github.com/AdamXweb/WhiteSurFirefoxThemeMacOS),

• Tested - It supposed to support all themes include native theme (Firefox Dark / Light)

• Tested - Bookmark Menu, minor issue (windows control button can't be clicked if bookmark menu active)

• Minimum script for minimum issues

# Please Note

Only tested in Windows 11, MacOs or Linux may also support this Theme but I just tested in Windows 11.
